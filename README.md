How to run the script
---------------------
To obtain a tidy dataset you have to run the script run_analysis.R from the root directory where the test and training dataset are placed.
Example of directory structure: 
/root/run_analysis.R
/root/test
/root/test/InertialSignals
/root/train

All you have to do is source the script in R and run it.
